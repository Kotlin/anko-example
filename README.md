Code in this repo shows how to set up [Anko](https://github.com/JetBrains/anko) library in the Android Gradle project. The application is very simple yet working and shows some important Anko concepts. Please take into account that to work with this code in Android Studio you will need to install Kotlin plugin from [JetBrains Plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954?pr=androidstudio).

The repo can be also used as a template, so it may be a nice starting point for your new app. Come get some! :thumbsup:
